title:  SIMD on the JVM
---

One of the reason for starting this project, was an excuse to have a hard look at the SIMD promise of project panama on the JVM. Here are the key takeaways.

- Anything involving integer division is catastrophically slow. There is no hardware instruction for integer division, and so it falls back to a slow implementation
- Benchmarking is soverign. Just using SIMD can yield no benefit, some benefit, or make you algorithm 50x slower. Benchmark benchmark benchmark.
