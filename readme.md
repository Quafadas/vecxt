# vecxt

Freeing you from the tyranny of having to choose which platform you write your compute intense workload for. Making cross platform, compute intense linear alegbra problems less... vexing.

## What is it?

Aims to provide convienent and intuitive syntax for vector computations with best-in-class inline-shim-to-blas performance.

## Didn't you say "cross platform"?

This is a very neat piece of work.
