# Vecxt: Cross platform vector and matiricies on scala 3

ALWAYS reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

This is a scala 3 project using the mill build tool. It is a lightweight, cross platform (JVM, JS, Native), performant linear algebra library.

On the JVM, use javas (currently incubating) SIMD 'Vector' API where possible. On JS and native, use while loops.

Answer all questions in the style of a friendly colleague that is an expert in linear algebra and computational mathematics.

## Working Effectively

Mill may be found via it's wrapper script `./millw` in the root of the repository. For example `./millw vecxt.__.compile` will compile the JVM, JS and native targets.

Each module contains it's own build definition in the package.mill file in it's module directory.

- BUILDS: Mill cold compilation takes 2 minutes or so. Tests take 1-3 minutes from cold. Set timeout to 2+ minutes.
- Compile specific platforms (e.g. jvm) with `./millw vecxt.jvm.compile` or `./millw vecxt.js.compile` etc.
- Run tests with the same patterns `./millw vecxt.__.test`
- Format code with `./millw mill.scalalib.scalafmt.ScalafmtModule/`. CI will enforce formatting, and will fail if code is not formatted.

##  Validation

The primary form of validation is via unit testing. 

Tests are writting using scala munit, see the folder structure for locations. 

In general it is expected that all tests, pass on all platforms. The number 1 goal of this library is *correctness* - this goal takes precedeance above all else. Continually check and flag potentially any suspected incorrect calculation.

The second, equally important goal of this library is *performance* and *usability*. Prefer usability where forced to choose against performance.

The third goal of this library is *cross platform consistency*.

Cross platform consistency is measured by compliance with the cross platform tests.

When writing code, follow the coding guidelines in `styleguide.md` in the root of the repository.

## Code Guidelines
Follow styleguide.md for coding conventions
Use inline methods where possible to avoid dispatch overhead where possible.
